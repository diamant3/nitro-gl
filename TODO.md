# TODO
3. plot sampling uvs = done
4. transform uvs of sampler = done

5. can make an optimized render node for rectangles: interleaved(one upload call) and constant ebo
6. maybe create a GVA - generic vertex attribute system
7. shader compositor
8. static pool
9. render node for triangle batches
10. test idea with backdrop sampling read
11. test idea of missing uvs coords for triangle batches
12. basic blending
13. basic compositing
14. a simple texture sampler
15. general texture sampler
16. AA with rbos or filter shader
17. implement many samplers
