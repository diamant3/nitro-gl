# TODO
3. plot sampling uvs = done
4. transform uvs of sampler = done

5. can make an optimized render node for rectangles: interleaved(one upload call) and constant ebo
6. shader compositor
7. static pool
8. render node for triangle batches
9. test idea with backdrop sampling read
10. test idea of missing uvs coords for triangle batches
11. basic blending
12. basic compositing
13. a simple texture sampler
14. general texture sampler
15. AA with rbos or filter shader
16. implement many samplers
