#### some notes

#### float points
- integer divisions are slower than float point divisions by an order of 3 from_sampler my tests.
- integers arithmetics are far accurate and float points are not so
- integers multiplications are a bit faster (5-10%) than float point multiplications

#### release vs debug of Q structs
- release mode highly optmizes these data structures as opposed to debug mode, soÂ§
for example if I am doing higly intensive Q struct arithmetics, they will seem slower
than raw fixed points arithmetics, BUT in release mode they will be optimized the same.

- ona 500*500/2 triangle rasterization, the prescence of one division, takes approx 1ms per triangle
- when testing, rasterization with many loops, amke sure, to alter coords in order to destroy cache.
  it seems, cpu caches integer divisions, therefore doing many loops of the same input will use cached
  results, which is misleading.

#### blend-modes/compositions are in-accurate for integer types
- in order to save on cpu cycles, then instead of dividing by (2^bits - 1) than I
  instead divide by 2^bits by using >>bits operation, the error of doing this is usually
  around 5%. How to make it better ?
  a. float workflow enablement with overloaded blending/compositing functions for float colors.
  b. assuming color channels are not more than 8 bit long, we can create a LUT for (1/i), where `0<i<=255`
     with 16 bit precision `LUT[i]=(1<<16)/i`, and then compute: `result= x/a` by `result=(x*LUT[a])>>16`.
     the size of the LUT will be `(256 entries)*(2bytes)=512 bytes= 0.5kb`. This will reduce errors to less than 1%.

#### Why don't I use general space colors
general space colors represent intensities of channels with numbers between `[0,1]`, but how to represent them?
good question, there are two options: float point or a 24 bit fixed point integer (comparable to float point in the [0,1] range).
we can implement this with a template like
```c++
template<typename number>
struct color {number r,g,b,a;}
```
*What are the pros and cons of using this space*
1. we can be agnostic of specific colors spaces in all phases of the engine except the loading/storing of a pixel phase- HUGE PRO
2. to convert from_sampler colors space into general space requires a division - HUGE CON
3. conversion to specific colors spaces is a matter of 4 multiplications which is easy - PRO
4. it is easier to implememnt many graphics constructs like shaders in general color space, although we can
   get around this with smart [0, 1] interpolation
5. blending/compositing can be done in general color space and be templated for generic number type - HUGE CON

*What to choose ?*
basically, 2) is a killer for this great feature of general color spaces, too much to pay even if we have a fast FPU.
we can of course save our frame-buffer in general color space to avoid conversions(probably GPU uses something like this,
or the dedicated FPU takes the penalty), but this means the buffer will be 16 bytes per pixel, to much cost in RAM memory.

*resolution ?*
- We want to support both fast and accurate modes.
- user will have a flag for integer-inaccurate blending or float-slow-accurate blending through overloading.
- if user is not happy, he can always implement his own blender and compositing struct, which is a feature of the engine.
- canvas/samplers/shaders should be written with thoughs for the custom colors space at times by user
