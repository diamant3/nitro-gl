#### notes
1. I follow OpenGL conventions, so fill on them when in search for more info.
2. camera space is right hand system positioned at the origin and looking down the negative z axis.
3. I perform camera space to clip in the matrix by dividing by w if w!={0,1}, for more control
   if clip space clipping is desired, then remove it from_sampler the matrix class and handle it.
4. I do not perform clip space clipping, but rather rely on z-buffering, why ?
   - clipping triangles in clip space means we also have to clip all vertex attributes
     with linear interpolation, which is the way openGL acts, but this also means I
     will require a more complicated pipeline, which I can avoid.
   - try to rely on frustum culling techniques instead


#### roadmap
1. software shaders.
a barycentric rasterizer, that returns pixels and barycentric weights fr you to evaluate

2. add z-buffer
and call it q buffer or so
